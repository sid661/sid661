### Who I Am

I’m a **product-oriented full stack engineer** who enjoys building systems that are  
**clear before clever, scalable before fast, and maintainable before trendy**.

I care about:
- how APIs are designed  
- how systems behave in production  
- how code reads six months later  

Engineering, to me, is about **good decisions under constraints**.

### Background

**PGP – Product Engineering (NIIT, 2021)**  

My training emphasized:
- strong computer science fundamentals  
- clean object-oriented design  
- real-world backend development  
- thinking in terms of systems, not just features  

This shaped how I approach software — with a balance of **theory, practice, and product sense**.
